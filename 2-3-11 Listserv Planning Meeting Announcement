Building,

Have you gotten a message from me saying your email to the risleyhall listserv didn't go through? 
Don't know what moderation* means??
Are you frustrated that your emails get delayed before actually going out?
Do you have other issues, ideas, thoughts about, or problems with the list servs? 

Come to the list servs planning meeting, tonight, Thursday night, February 3 at 7pm. It will be in the CLR. (should only take a half hour)

This will be about both risleyhall-l and squidserv.

Come express your thoughts, ideas, and opinions. This meeting will impact the future of email in the building! You will be impacted by the outcome of this meeting!
We can decide how we want the list servs to work, what rule we want in place, how we feel about moderation*, among other topics.

Come use your voice!
See you then! CLR, 7-730pm!
Thanks,
Your dutiful webmaster,
Gabriel

* (where I, as the webmaster, have to approve your emails for a system before they get delivered to risleyhall)
