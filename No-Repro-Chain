Tl;Dr: Tom Levine devises a way to keep the Squid from sending you a copy of your own email.  Gabe is not happy--he + RA Lauren wanted to avoid this.
All emails sent 11/30/2010.

Tom Levine to Squid:
> Squidserve-l used to send me copies of emails that I sent it. This got
> me erroneously excited about having received new emails, which led
> invariably to disappointment. But that has all changed! I sent an
> email to squidserve-l-request@cornell.edu
> with the body:
>   set norepro
> 
> Or if you really like this feature, you can send an email to
> risleyhall-l-request@cornell.edu
> with the body:
>   set repro
> 
> Considering that I wanted to adjust this, I figure other people wanted it too.

Webmaster Gabe to Squid:
> found it.
> Please don't send policy things out to the building without running it by me first.
> It's nice that people want to help, but when you don't check in one invariably runs the chance of stepping on someone's toes or getting in the way.
> Policy things need to come from the webmaster / RHD / staff (maybe) ONLY.
> This was a policy that Lauren and I agreed on, and we want everyone on repro. Now I need to go set you back to it, and anyone else that changes it because we don't want people on norepro.
> 
> Now that the info is out there, my primary way of stopping it is sabotaged.
> thanks for trying to help.
> Webmaster

Ben L. to Webmaster Gabe:
> Just out of curiosity, why is this policy?  What is the reasoning behind
> wanting every one on repro?  Gabe, I also don't think the sarcasm makes
> your message more effective when dealing with an option that wasn't
> patently policy.
> Sincerely,
> Ben L.

Webmaster Gabe to Squid, copy of Ben L.'s email included:
> Ben, (et all just to clarify)
> I wasn't being sarcastic.
> I legitimately meant to thank tom for trying to help with the listservs, and I believe we have the same goals. Though as I pointed out with the stepping on toes thing, it ocaisionally doesn't work so hot.
> Sorry that didn't come across.
> Webmaster
