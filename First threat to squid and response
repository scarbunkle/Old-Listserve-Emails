> Dear Squid Serve Users,
> I am sending this message in response to the recent comments posted on the squid-serve.  
> I am concerned that what was intended to be a “public and unmoderated forum” has become 
> controversial.   The point of the squidserve was to remove the “spam” from the Risley 
> listserve.  Please continue to use the squidserve as you see fit.  In stating that emails 
> meant for a small group of people should not be sent on the squidserve, Gabriel was trying 
> to make sure that the squidserve does not spam your inbox as well.  You are free to send 
> whatever emails you like on the squid as long as it is not offensive.
> 
> In addition, you are free to remove yourself from the squidserve should you wish by 
> emailing the Gabriel the Webmaster.  Please refrain from calling each other out over email.  
> If you have an issue with something stated on the listserve, please talk to me, Gabriel or 
> any of the RA Staff.   If this continues to be a problem or is not meeting the needs of our 
> community, I am comfortable cancelling the squidserve.

> Thanks!

Bennett W. to RHD Lauren, Webmaster Gabe, Kirsten P.:
> Dear Lauren,
> 
> I do not find bold threats to cancel a very socially useful mode of communication to be 
> beneficial or justified in this situation.
> Since the main RisleyHall list is now moderated, many questions of building policy 
> (unburdening or informing RAs) and a great deal of resource sharing among residents is 
> facilitated effectively only by this resource.
> The extent of "calling one another out" on the Squidserve (Spam) list has been merely a 
> policy debate on how to organize the digital resources of the community. Even though this 
> discussion might be best limited to a few individuals or even best held in person, this 
> is not a reason to go about threatening its demise.
> If this message was sent with the intent of backing up Gabriel, our Webmaster, on matters 
> of list policy, then I do not find that expressing willingness to stamp out our ability to 
> freely communication and control our interaction with this public forum is a productive way 
> to do so. I think the expressed desire that matters of policy be brought to you privately 
> was quite sufficient.

> Sincerely,
> Bennett W

Bennett W. to Squid, above email attached:
> Hello Risley Residents,
> I am forwarding this message to you because I believe that keeping the Squidserve alive 
> is a matter we should be vitally concerned about.
> I believe that matters of listserv policy are best addressed by focused groups of people 
> talking in person but I also believe that we should not settle for dictates of our ability 
> to communicate handed down by fiat. We should have input when we request it, in a way that 
> does not excessively spam the community and yet brings us all to our desired level of 
> participation.
> 
> I would like to request that you express your discomfort with the unnecessary notion of 
> harpooning the Squidserve to RHD Lauren and our Webmaster Gabe in an appropriate manner.
> 
> Sincerely,
> Bennett W
