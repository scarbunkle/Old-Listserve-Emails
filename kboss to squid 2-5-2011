One, two, three, lets argue on the listserve about stuff that has no actual effect on real life!

Read: take it easy, Ris, and don't let the internet get you down, whether it be because someone say "Kleenex" instead of "facial tissues" (the difference is, one is harvested from old-growth forests, special for you!), or because someone cares whether you say "Kleenex" or "facial tissues".

Let's get back to the real, serious issue at hand: who peed on the toilet seat?  I demand answers via the listserve, as this is an appropriate forum to air personal contention with individuals within the community.

Love,
kboss.

P.S.
Listserve drama brings light into my life.  Keep it up, in the spirit of everlasting comedy!  Go forth and make things unnecessarily ridiculous, RisKids!

P.P.S.
First Annual Indignant ("F the 5-0") Snowball Fight on the RisLawn?  Anyone down?
